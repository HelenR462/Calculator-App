## Summary

This calculator app is a great example of something that seems like it should be really simple but it's far from it. Not only is there quite a bit of work involved just to make it look like a calculator on the screen, mathematical order of operations threw me for a loop. Trying to get a running tally while having to follow proper order of operations proved to be a little more complicated than I thought.

The best part about building this app, that took me about 1 1/2 weeks, is that it forced me to spend a lot of time in the planning and whiteboarding stage as opposed to jumping in too quickly. I was forced to come up with an algorithm to figure out how to manage the calculations and then choose a data structure that best fit it.

I'm really happy with how this turned out from both a visual user design to the functionality working well.
